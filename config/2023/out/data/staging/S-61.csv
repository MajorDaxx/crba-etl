The numerator is the result of the number of employed women, whose sector, occupation or other personal characteristics are explicitly included in the scope of the labour code or social security law (legally covered) minus the number of legally covered employed women who do not meet the eligibility require- ments to access the right to maternity cash benefits (legally ineligible).

The numerator is the result of the number of employed women, whose sector, occupation or other personal characteristics are explicitly included in the scope of the labour code or social security law (legally covered) minus the number of legally covered employed women who do not meet the eligibility require- ments to access the right to maternity cash benefits (legally ineligible). The denominator is the number of women in employment, without discrimination as to age, nationality, marital status or residence, instead of the number of women in employment who are statutorily covered. The number of women in employment was preferred since the share of women covered in law is an estimate expressed in a broad range.

The numerator is the result of the number of employed women, whose sector, occupation or other personal characteristics are explicitly included in the scope of the labour code or social security law (legally covered) minus the number of legally covered employed women who do not meet the eligibility require- ments to access the right to maternity cash benefits (legally ineligible). The denominator is the number of women in employment, without discrimination as to age, nationality, marital status or residence, instead of the number of women in employment who are statutorily covered. The number of women in employment was preferred since the share of women covered in law is an estimate expressed in a broad range. Therefore, using the first denominator allows the calculation of an indicator that is more statistically robust.
