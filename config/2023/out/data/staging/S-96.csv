DNK;Denmark;2018;no;"There is currently no Danish legislation that requires ISPs to report suspected child pornography to the Danish authorities. However,
the Department of Justice has since 2005 implemented a model based on voluntary agreements and close cooperation with a majority
of internet distributors to prevent access to a material of child pornographic nature via the internet. This effort is operationalized through
so-called ‘net-filters’, which are established based on specific agreements between the authorities and the individual internet
distributors. These agreements enable the Danish authorities to forward suspicious web addresses to the distributors and request that
access to them is blocked. Email from Kristine Sorgenfri Hansen, Intern, Royal Danish Embassy, Washington, D.C., to the International

IRL;Ireland;2018;no;The research correctly states that Irish legislation does not require Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to report suspected child pornography to law enforcement or to some other mandated agency. The internet service providers in Ireland are not required to seek out illegal content on their networks. In line with the EU Ecommerce Directive (2000/31), the ISPs are ‘mere conduits’ and they are not required to police the content carried on their networks. Where illegal content is drawn to the notice of an ISP then the ISP takes content down. This is referred to as ‘notice and takedown’. The mechanism that is used for dealing with notice and takedown is Hotline.ie. Hotline.ie is the confidential service for reporting illegal content in the internet in Ireland. It is operated by the Internet Service Providers Association of Ireland and it is funded by them and also by EU funding under the EU Safer Internet Programme.

PAN;Panama;2018;no;The Criminal Code of Panama was amended by Law 21 of 2018, enacted on March 2018. This law modified certain articles related to crimes of Corruption of Minors and Sexual Commercial Exploitation. Article 189. Anyone who has knowledge of the use of minors in the execution of any of the crimes contemplated in this Chapter, whether this knowledge has been obtained by reason of his/her office, position, business or profession, or by any other source and omits to report it to the competent authorities shall be punished with imprisonment from one to three years. In virtue of the above, since the Internet Service Providers (ISP) can obtain knowledge of suspected child sexual abuse material through the internet due to its business, it is stated in the law that they must report this situation to our law enforcement authorities. Otherwise, they can be prosecuted without exceptions since the regulation is broad.

SWE;Sweden;2018;no;In Act (1998:112) on responsibility for Electronic Bulletin Boards (the BBS Act) there are rules that aim to prevent the spread of child pornography. A supplier of an electronic bulletin board is obliged to supervise the service to an extent that is reasonable considering the extent and objective of the service. The supplier is also obligated to remove a message, or in some other way make it inaccessible, if it is obvious that the content constitutes certain crimes, for example child pornography. A person who intentionally or by gross negligence, violates this obligation can be sentenced to a fine or to imprisonment for not more than six months, or, if the offence is grave, to imprisonment for not more than two years. It is also important to acknowledge the extensive preventive work that is carried out by the authorities. For example there is an established and successful voluntary cooperation between the Police and the Internet Service Providers, which leads to the blocking of commercial Internet web sites that contain child pornography. Around 90 % of subscribers to the Internet in Sweden are covered in this voluntary cooperation.

CHE;Switzerland;2018;no;"ISPs do not have a legal obligation to monitor and report suspected child pornography; however, Switzerland has created a special entity – the Cybercrime Coordination Unit Switzerland (CYCO) – where persons can report suspicious Internet subject matter. The Coordination Unit cooperates closely with ISP’s and may, on a case to case basis, ask them to take appropriate measures to block respectively delete certain content. CYCO also actively searches for criminal subject matter on the Internet and is responsible for indepth analysis of cybercrime. It is possible for the public to report child pornography cases to CYCO. Today about 80% of ISPs in Switzerland have agreements with CYCO.

GBR;United Kingdom;2018;yes;"The United Kingdom does not explicitly state that ISPs must report suspected child abuse images to law enforcement or to some mandated agency; however, ISPs may be held liable for third party content if it hosts or caches content on its servers and possession may possibly occur in the jurisdiction where the serve is located. In the United Kingdom, possession is an offense and as such ISPs will report suspected child abuse material to law enforcement once they are aware of it. Letter from Nick Lewis, Counselor, Embassy of Great Britain, Washington, D.C., to the International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children (Dec. 16, 2009) (on file with the International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children). I can confirm that child pornography in the United Kingdom is covered by the Protection of Children Act 1978, which makes it illegal to take, make, distribute, show or possess an indecent photograph or pseudo-photograph of someone under the age of 18. In the context of digital media, saving an indecent image to a computer’s hard drive is considered “making” the image, as it causes a copy to exist which did not exist before. This law is in force in England, Wales and Northern Ireland….The prohibition of content on the Internet, that is potentially illegal under this law by British internet service providers, is however self-regulatory, coordinate by the nonprofit charity Internet Watch Foundation (who has partnerships with many major ISPs in the country). The IWF operates in informal partnership with the police, government, public and Internet service providers.
