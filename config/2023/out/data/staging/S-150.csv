These claims generally arise in areas of Canada where Aboriginal land rights have not been dealt with by treaty or through other legal means. Through negotiation with the aboriginal signatories, the land claims settlement area is divided into different types of lands, offering different types of lands. They range from aboriginal ownership to resource access rights over public lands. Only land rights will be considered in this estimation, i.e. tracts of lands providing aboriginal parties a certain level of control over their lands, exercised through exclusion or management rights. Indigenous ownership cover 64.45 Mha, and 334.37 Mha of public lands are designated to aboriginal signatories.

No. 12 of 1974 guarantees the ownership of individuals and communities based upon registered title and adds â€˜The State also guarantees the ownership rights of any person or community who can claim to exercise customary rights over the land they useâ€™ (Art. 2). This has been interpreted in opposite ways, as meaning no title is required for security, or that title is still required but that customary use can be a basis of such entitlement.<br>There is no provision for off-farm lands to be secured. This has induced conflict since the 1970s in reference to rights to forests and especially to rangelands in the north. The law is clear that both assets are state property.<br>The strength of the Togo land law is that it was one of the first in Africa to allow collective rights to be registered (such as for family farms) but with above constraints. The area of rural Togo subject to formal title is estimated here as 5%.;2017;
