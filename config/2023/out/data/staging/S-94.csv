CHN;China;2018;Yes there is legislation specific to CSAM but it does NOT have an adequate CSAM definition;"182: CSAM legislation in Hong Kong differs from that in China. Legislation in Hong Kong:
 defines CSAM;
 criminalizes technology-facilitated CSAE offenses; and
 criminalizes simple possession of CSAM.
Taiwan has legislation specific to CSAM that:
 defines CSAM;
 criminalizes technology-facilitated CSAM offenses;
 criminalizes simple possession of CSAM; and
 mandates ISPs to report CSAM.
Macau has legislation specific to CSAM, but has not yet fulfilled the remaining criteria.  183: Article 367 stipulates the definition of “obscene articles”, i.e., sex-propagating books, periodicals, films, video- and audio-tapes, pictures and other obscene articles which concretely describe sexual acts or openly publicize sex. Given that the above provisions in the Criminal Law of China include child pornography, there is no separate law or definition exclusively on child pornography. That said, it is important to note that child pornography is covered by China’s criminal legislation and relevant crimes are subject to severe punishment.

SWE;Sweden;2018;Yes there is legislation specific to CSAM and it has an adequate CSAM definition;The definition for child pornography is articulated in the Preparatory Work and is referred to and applied by the courts in practice. In Chapter 16, Section 10a, of the Criminal Code there is a definition of the word child. There is no legal definition of child pornography in the legislation. Nevertheless, there are statements in the preparatory works to the effect that an image is to be regarded as pornographic when it, without any scientific or artistic values, depicts a sexual motif in an unconcealed and offensive way. Email from Magdalena Wikstrand Danelius, Legal Adviser, Division for Criminal Law, Ministry of Justice of Sweden, Washington, D.C., to the International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children (Nov. 18, 2011) (on file with the International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children). Government Bill 1997/98: 43 Freedom of the Press Ordinance and Speech Constitution scopes - pornography issue, etc. p. 56 “The image should, according to common use of language and general values, be pornographic in its content for it to be considered criminal in court….By pornographic, according to the statement of grounds in this section, the image under investigation should not have scientific or artistic value. The image is clearly intended to arouse a sexual reaction (Bill 1970:125 P. 79 f.). It is not required that the image depicts a child engaged in sexual conduct in order for it to be covered by the law. The criminal area, which regulates whether an image is considered to be pornographic, also includes images which in any other way portray one or several children in a way that is likely to appeal to an individual’s sex drive.”(translation);;;;;;;;;;;;SE;SWE;SWE;nan
